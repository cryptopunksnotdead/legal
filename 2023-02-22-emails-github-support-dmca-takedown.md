Hi (Crypto) Punk's Not Dead - 24Ã—24 Pixel Art on the Blockchain!,

I'm contacting you on behalf of GitHub because we've received notice that you
have taken the allegedly infringing content and linked an external website that
contains the infringing content, in the following URL:

https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/.github/tree/master/profile#readme

We're giving you 1 business day to remove the URL that contains the infringing
content. Once you've made changes, please reply to this message and let us
know. If you don't tell us that you've made changes within the next 1 business
day, we may need to disable the entire repository according to our GitHub DMCA
Takedown Policy and our Terms of Service:

https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service

If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA
takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a
counter notice, as described in our DMCA Takedown Policy.

PLEASE NOTE: It is important that you reply to this message within 1 business
day to tell us whether you've made changes. If you do not, the repository will
be disabled.
