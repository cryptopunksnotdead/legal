Hi (Crypto) Punk's Not Dead - 24Ã—24 Pixel Art on the Blockchain!,

I'm contacting you on behalf of GitHub because we've received a DMCA
takedown notice regarding the following content:

https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/lets-go-programming-cryptopunks

We're giving you 1 business day to make the changes identified in the
following notice:

[private]/2023-02-14-morepunks.rtf

If you need to remove specific content from your repository, simply
making the repository private or deleting it via a commit won't
resolve the alleged infringement. Instead, you must follow these
instructions to remove the content from your repository's history,
even if you don't think it's sensitive:

https://docs.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data

Once you've made changes, please reply to this message and let us
know. If you don't tell us that you've made changes within the next 1
business day, we'll need to disable the entire repository according to
our GitHub DMCA Takedown Policy:

https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/

If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a
DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by
submitting a counter notice, as described in our DMCA Takedown Policy.

PLEASE NOTE: It is important that you reply to this message within 1
business day to tell us whether you've made changes. If you do not,
the repository will be disabled.

and
