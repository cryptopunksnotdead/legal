## Subreddit Ban Appeal on r/CryptoPunksDev - Full Text

  I am new to report abuse by anonymous crypto bros followed by a complete ban (without any notice) on r/CryptoPunksDev

  Today I "filed" a Subreddit Ban Appeal  - that is, sending a direct message to r/reddit.com  (that is what the mods on r/modsupport are telling me is the proper channel / way). The text reads:




Hello,

I found out today (February, 28th 2023) by surprise without any notice that r/CryptoPunksDev is blocked / shutdown with "This community has been banned" saying:

> This subreddit was banned due to a violation of Reddit's content
> policy against harassing content.
>
> Banned 3 hours ago.

I (Gerald Bauer, from Austria with a nine-year club and verified-email user reddit account) am the founder / admin / mod of this r/CryptoPunksDev forum/subreddit on reddit with a 3 year or more history and hundreds of posts.

Note: The r/CryptoPunksDev is an education initiative to help with warning about crypto fraud / scams (and, thus, some might be unhappy like the anonymous crypto brother filing the harassment report abuse).

I got hit on the big or little sister site on github (https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead) with a take down filed by "More Punks" about a week ago (and I posted on this reddit for updates) and I counter filed on github on Friday, February 24th last-week with a copy posted on this reddit again for updates).

Anyways, please help how I can proceed to get the forum unbanned or what steps I can do next or if you need more info. If you think a post is in appropriate, please delete the post (or tell me to delete the post if that is possible).

Thanks you for your understanding and any help. Looking forward to your response.

Gerald Bauer
