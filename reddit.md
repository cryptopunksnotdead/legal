         Appeal To Unban r/CryptoPunksDev  - I Am The Founder / Mod

Hello,

any help appreciated on getting r/CryptoPunksDev unbanned.

The cause as far as I can tell is the posting of updates on the DMCA Attack by "More Punks" on github  
(see https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead).  
I am the founder / mod of the subreddit with a 3+ year of history and hundreds of posts.

I didn't really get any notice on the ban  - 
as a show of good faith I am happy to remove / delete all posts on the github dmca update  
with no questions asked on my side.

I filed an appeal before some weeks ago that reads for your reference:

Hello, 

I found out today (February, 28th 2023) by surprise without any notice that r/CryptoPunksDev 
is blocked / shutdown with "This community has been banned" saying:

> This subreddit was banned due to a violation of Reddit's content
> policy against harassing content.
>
> Banned 3 hours ago.

I (Gerald Bauer, from Austria with a nine-year club and verified-email user reddit account) am the founder / admin / mod of this r/CryptoPunksDev forum/subreddit on reddit with a 3 year or more history and hundreds of posts.

Note: The r/CryptoPunksDev is an education initiative to help with warning about crypto fraud / scams (and, thus, some might be unhappy like the anonymous crypto brother filing the harassment report abuse).

I got hit on the big or little sister site on github (https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead) with a take down filed by "More Punks" about a week ago (and I posted on this reddit for updates) and I counter filed on github on Friday, February 24th last-week with a copy posted on this reddit again for updates).

Anyways, please help how I can proceed to get the forum unbanned or what steps I can do next or if you need more info. If you think a post is in appropriate, please delete the post (or tell me to delete the post if that is possible).

Thanks you for your understanding and any help. Looking forward to your response.

Gerald Bauer

Again any help appreciated.  Thanks in advance. Cheers.

PS:  
Note:  As discussed on r/DIYPunkArt  (I am the founder / mod there too) 
I have found a volunteer to bring on a second mod if that is a concern on r/CryptoPunksDev.

A week later nothing but silence...   
 ever the optimist to reach someone I try again with an all new text sent to the Community Team with a private message on

          Asking to Unban r/CryptoPunksDev  (Ban Request Caused by "More Punks")

Hello,
Dear Community Team,

  Asking for help to appeal the ban of r/CryptoPunksDev I was refered here: 

> Send a modmail here with all of the details.

  To make it short and easy on you - I (Gerald Bauer, b.1972 - living near Vienna in Austria) 
am a Nine-Year Club redditer with verified email  ( gerald.bauer @ gmail.com ) and 
a post karma of 6 400 pts - and I founded / started and mod the r/CryptoPunksDev subreddit 
about two+ years ago (with hundreds of posts)  that got banned without notice on February, 23rd 2023.

  I am happy to do whatever it takes to get the r/CryptoPunksDev subreddit back / unbanned - 
  no questions asked.  Here's what I do if you unban the subreddit (again with no questions asked):

-  Delete all posts related to "More Punks DCMA GitHub Take Down Filing & Updates" 
   that is my understanding caused "More Punks" to  file a harassing request that caused 
   a complete ban of the subreddit  (note: I was asking in a reddit post for help 
   who is behind the "More Punks" handle since got take downs without a contact information...) 
-  Bring on a new mod  (to help if anyone feels reports get ignored for too long)

  If there's more that I can do and you ask for, please tell.  

  Yours truly,
   Gerald Bauer

PS: Background:  The (reai) cause seems that the (anonymous) "More Punks" crypto bro  
was taken aback with the smashing success of the "Ordinal Punks" on bitcoin 
this February 2023 and full of envy and rage that his own "original" 1000 More Punks collection 
is not selling anything (on the open sea market for months) but the claimed copycat 
is going for hundred of thousands dollar a piece and pulling in millions of dollars.

Note:  I am a no-coiner with zero crypo tokens / coins  (HODLing: 0 punks or otherwise) 
and not affiliated with (100) Ordinal Punks.  The open source text-to-image machinery by myself 
under the "punk's not dead" umbrella is on github with a public domain dedication 
and free to use for anyone.  The ordinal punks (anonymous) founder "Flow Stay" used 
the open source code & spritesheet and linked backed on the ordinalspunks.com website (or on twitter) 
and, that, looks like started the whole affair by "More Punks" thinking 
I am somehow behind the "Ordinal Punks" operations.    

Anyways, I never was contacted by "More Punks" by email or dm here even though I am "doxxed".  
While I try to reach out to "More Punks" to find out more - alas, the website has been "down" 
for months - see http://www.morepunks.com and the dns records say the domain 
expired on April 3rd, 2023  see https://who.is/whois/morepunks.com -  
as a Austrian I feel like reliving Kafka's Process.

So far I only got: "Your message has been delivered" after pressing the send button on April 7th, 2023.
