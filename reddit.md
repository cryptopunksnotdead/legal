**Appeal To Unban r/CryptoPunksDev  - I Am The Founder / Mod**

Hello,

any help appreciated on getting r/CryptoPunksDev unbanned.

The cause as far as I can tell is the posting of updates on the DMCA Attack by "More Punks" on github  
(see https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead).  
I am the founder / mod of the subreddit with a 3+ year of history and hundreds of posts.

I didn't really get any notice on the ban  - 
as a show of good faith I am happy to remove / delete all posts on the github dmca update  
with no questions asked on my side.

I filed an appeal before some weeks ago that reads for your reference:

Hello, 

I found out today (February, 28th 2023) by surprise without any notice that r/CryptoPunksDev 
is blocked / shutdown with "This community has been banned" saying:

> This subreddit was banned due to a violation of Reddit's content
> policy against harassing content.
>
> Banned 3 hours ago.

I (Gerald Bauer, from Austria with a nine-year club and verified-email user reddit account) am the founder / admin / mod of this r/CryptoPunksDev forum/subreddit on reddit with a 3 year or more history and hundreds of posts.

Note: The r/CryptoPunksDev is an education initiative to help with warning about crypto fraud / scams (and, thus, some might be unhappy like the anonymous crypto brother filing the harassment report abuse).

I got hit on the big or little sister site on github (https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead) with a take down filed by "More Punks" about a week ago (and I posted on this reddit for updates) and I counter filed on github on Friday, February 24th last-week with a copy posted on this reddit again for updates).

Anyways, please help how I can proceed to get the forum unbanned or what steps I can do next or if you need more info. If you think a post is in appropriate, please delete the post (or tell me to delete the post if that is possible).

Thanks you for your understanding and any help. Looking forward to your response.

Gerald Bauer

Again any help appreciated.  Thanks in advance. Cheers.

PS:  
Note:  As discussed on r/DIYPunkArt  (I am the founder / mod there too) 
I have found a volunteer to bring on a second mod if that is a concern on r/CryptoPunksDev.
