## UNDER ATTACK

Since Febuary 16th, 2023 the (crypto) punk's not dead org (& repos) are under attack.

I (Gerald Bauer) am the founder / admin / maintainer of the org
and try to document the abuse and absurdity.

Note:  I counter-filed to the dcma take-down on February 24th, 2023.

Note:  I documentend and posted the call to help
first to [**r/CryptoPunksDev**](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoPunksDev) (where I am the founder / admin of the subreddit)  and the subreddit got banned (closed-down without notice) on February 28th, 2023  -
I assume for a post where I ask for help, that is, "Please, Help - Who Is The Crypto Bro (Or Who Are The Buy-Out Investor(s)) Behind the Anonymous (1000) More Punks Operation - Any Tips & (Inside) Information Welcome"
Believe it or not - the anoynmous crypto bro(s) behind "More Punks" claim a violation of Reddit's content policy against  harassing content and delete a forum
with hundreds of posts and a 3-year-history
without any notice.  Absurd?

Note: I sent a ban appeal to r/reddit.com on Feburary 28th, 2023 (and ten days later still waiting... for any sign of help on what's going on).



I document and posted the call for help here on the org readme
via  [**/.github**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/.github)  and - believe it or not -
the crypto bro(s) attacker(s)  filed a term-of-service violation
to follow-up on the take down
and now the readme page is "disabled" - see [**/.github**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/.github).
Absurd?


I appealed the term-of-service violation on github on February 28th, 2023.


So far zero response via the official support channels
from github and reddit
and  no emails (or postal mail)
from the lawyer(s) from the crypto bro(s) attacking
or the crypto bro(s) themselves
even github policy states that the first step (even before filing a dmca take down or term-of-service violation)
is asking my humble self first. I am "doxxed" and easy to contact.
