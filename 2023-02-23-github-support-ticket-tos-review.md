# Github Support Ticket - TOS Review: cryptopunksnotdead/.github


Date:  February 23rd, 2023


Hello,

I am the founder / maintainer of the cryptopunksnotdead org on github - I am a open source & open data programmer for 20+ years (a 50-year old nobody from Austria near Vienna.)

I got hit by 10 take down notices (by More Punks - an anonymous (crypto) brother ) - this is my first time with github (or really anywhere) to work through the take down process - I did NOT get contact before by the person (or persons) behind More Punks - my email is public).

Anyways, most repos are awesome pages, that is, notes and others or step-by-step programming tutorials. Anyways, what I am trying to say the plan is that I remove the More Punks references (the ironically were free promotion and I can make the point with any other collection)
in most repos and for two or three I will counter file if that is possible as a non-US citizen.

Anyways, sorry for the background - the latest taketown notice came in yesterday (per email via github) about cryptopunksnotdead./github again I was offline and see just the disabled profile page. Can you please, review the decision and give me a one-day window to make the change once I know what link is claimed to be offending and I will make the change.

Thanks you for the understanding and help and great service (ot open source / data programmers).
Sorry for all the trouble caused by a random (anonymous) crypto bro ("More Punks").

Cheers.

**Update**  FYI - I filed a counter notice today (via the Github Online Counter Notice Form) today (that is, Fri Feb 24th) on the takedown of 10 cryptopunksnotdead repos that was hitting me by the same filer I assume as this TOS filing.

Note: As a show of good faith I am happy to make the requested changes on the readme on cryptopunksnotdead/.github
